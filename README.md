# Cross Protocol Attack on Vehicular Network using IPSec
This repository contains the files related to the project "Cross Protocol Attack on Vehicular Network using IPSec"
The intent of this work is to explore the vulnerabilities of vehicular networks when exposed to cross protocol attacks, specifically focusing on networks secured with the IPSec protocol. However, due to certain constraints, we have only managed to successfully set up a testbed for the vehicular network incorporating IPSec for secure communications.

Our testbed is composed of two setups: an instance of Automotive Grade Linux (AGL), customized to include IPSec support, and a simulation setup within OMNET++ and INET, again with IPSec incorporated. These setups, create a comprehensive environment to investigate the behavior and potential vulnerabilities of vehicular networks secured with IPSec.

This repository contains details about both the setup and instructions necessary for setting up and experimenting with the testbed.
